Project Title To-Do List API

Project Overview

This project involves developing a RESTful API to manage a simple to-do list application. The API will allow users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on their tasks. The purpose is to practice backend development fundamentals, such as building APIs, handling HTTP requests, and interacting with a database.

Key Features:

1.Sign-in/Sign-up page: username,email-id,password.

2.Add a new task with a title and description.

3.Retrieve all tasks or a specific task by its ID.

4.Update a task (mark it as complete or modify details).

5.Delete a task.

6.Optional: Implement user authentication for task ownership.

Tech Stack:

1.Backend: Node.js with Express.js

2.Database: MongoDB (using Mongoose for schema and queries)

3.Tools: Postman (for testing the API), Git for version control

4.Frontend : React or HTML/CSS for basic task visualization (optional at this stage).

Why This Project:

Practical Skills: Learn how to design and build RESTful APIs, manage a database, and implement basic CRUD operations.

Problem solving skill: Learn how to solve the daily problems faced by the user.

Hands-On Learning: Itâ€™s a simple yet effective way to explore backend development concepts.

Relevance: To-do lists are commonly used applications, making this project relatable and valuable for showcasing skills.

Future Expansion: Can be extended to include user authentication, task deadlines, and notifications.
